The functions rely on a JSON library for Java which can be found here: https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java

I have also pushed the version of the library I was for these functions.

The functions are found in ContainerConverter.java. The function for the first part is called toSingleDimension().
The function for the second part is called toMultiDimension(). There is also a JUnit test file called TestContainerConverter.java that
utilizes the example case.
